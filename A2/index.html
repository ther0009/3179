        <p> Bulk-billing sits at the heart of affordable GP care in Australia. This visualisation explores three questions: How accessible is bulk-billing today? How affordable is it across states and over time? And how can patients make the most of the options available where they live? Use the interactive views to compare locations, track trends for past years and see which groups rely on bulk-billing the most.</p>

          <h3>Access to bulk-billing in Australia</h3>
          <p>Bulk-billing services are plentiful in Australia’s population dense clusters which span the
             east-coast capitals and larger regional centres, while coverage thins in remote inland areas.
             If you’re in a well-served suburb, make the most of it: nearby options can mean shorter waits,
             easier access, and lower out-of-pocket costs.</p>
          <p>Use the <em>Service type</em> toggle below the map to switch categories (e.g., general practice,
             hospital outpatient, pharmacy). General practice and pharmacy services dominate overall supply,
             while hospital-based options cluster around larger towns and cities.</p>

        <h3>Breaking it down per State</h3>
          <p>This stacked bar chart shows the number of bulk-billing service providers by state, with the colours indicating service types.</p>
          <p>The picture is clear: provider numbers are concentrated in the east-coast states such as NSW, VIC and QLD. It is driven mainly by general practice and pharmacy services. WA and SA sit in the middle, while TAS, ACT and NT have far fewer providers overall, reflecting smaller and more dispersed populations. Hospital-based services (e.g., outpatient clinics, hospital/ED pharmacies) make up a much smaller slice everywhere compared with community GP and pharmacy.

        <h3>How Bulk-Billing has changed over time</h3>
        <p>This ten-year before/after view shows every state’s bulk-billing rate has fallen.
Declines are largest in NT, WA and SA, moderate in NSW/Vic/QLD, and smallest in ACT/Tas.
The drop reflects practice costs rising faster than rebates and a shift towards mixed billing, especially outside major cities.
The bottom line is bulk-billing is less common today across Australia than a decade ago.</p>

          <p>Use the Year slider to step through time and see how every state’s bulk-billing rate trends downward.
The red vertical line is the national average. Watch it shift as the mix of states changes each year.</p>
<p>This broad decline reflects practice costs rising faster than Medicare rebates, a shift to mixed billing, and workforce pressures (especially outside major cities).</p>
<p>Fun fact: 2022 had the highest bulk-billing rate across Australia, likely due to a post-pandemic catch-up.</p>

        <h3>Who is it benefitting the most?</h3>
        <p>On the left, the stacked bars show the total value of bulk-billed services paid by government to each age group each year. On the right, the same data is shown as proportions, making it easier to compare who receives the largest share of rebates.

        <p>The 16–64 group takes the biggest slice in every year, while the 65+ group’s share edges up and 0–15 remains the smallest and fairly steady. Together, the two views show both the scale of spending and the distribution across age groups.
          Rebates are dominated by the 16–64 group simply because they’re the largest cohort, while the 65+ share is gradually increasing as older Australians use more GP care per person. 0–15 remains the smallest slice. The brief 2022 spike likely reflects post-pandemic catch-up.

        <p>This bubble chart plots each state’s points by bulk-billing rate (%) on the x-axis and average patient contribution ($) on the y-axis. Colour distinguishes states, bubble size indicates the age group (0–15, 16–64, 65+), and you can switch Quarter to compare periods.</p>

        <p>There isn’t a clean, linear link between higher bulk-billing and lower out-of-pocket costs. That’s because clinics use mixed billing differently, the service mix (short vs long consults, procedures) and local cost structures vary, and the average contribution is calculated only for non-bulk-billed visits, so it changes in who pays (and which age group) can move dollars without a matching shift in the bulk-billing percentage. In short, pricing policies, timing effects and more blur a simple one-to-one trend.</p>

          <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1 outline_container">
        <p> In short: Australia still has broad access to GP services, especially in cities. However bulk-billing rates have fallen and out-of-pocket costs are creeping up, with differences by state and age group. The shift toward mixed billing, rising practice costs and uneven regional coverage explain much of the decline. To make the most of it, compare local clinics and service types, ask about bulk-billed options (e.g., for children, concession card holders, short/telehealth consults), and use community clinics or advertised bulk-billing windows to keep costs down. </p>
